# DS Challenge Frontend

## About

- This is an app created to show my favorite 'You Died' meme gifs. It as a searchable section for all gifs and a section for my favorite gifs, which are added or removed from the all gifs section. A User will be able to add remove or edit any of the gifs from the all section. The "challenge" part of the app is that I expect to be able to create this app within 1-hour, with proper convention and robust code. Each branch. outside of the master branch, will represent a different attempt. At a later time, I will even open this challenge up to take in an api and have user login.
